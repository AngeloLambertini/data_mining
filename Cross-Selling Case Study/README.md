### 21.8 Catalog Cross-Selling

CatalogCrossSell.csv is the dataset for this case study.

#### Background
Exeter, Inc. is a catalog firm that sells products in a number of different catalogs that
it owns. The catalogs number in the dozens, but fall into nine basic categories:

1. Clothing
2. Housewares
3. Health
4. Automotive
5. Personal electronics
6. Computers
7. Garden
8. Novelty gift
9. Jewelry

The costs of printing and distributing catalogs are high. By far the biggest cost of
operation is the cost of promoting products to people who buy nothing. Having
invested so much in the production of artwork and printing of catalogs, Exeter wants
to take every opportunity to use them effectively.
One such opportunity is in cross-selling — once a customer has “taken the bait” and purchases one product, try to sell them another while you have their attention.
Such cross-promotion might take the form of enclosing a catalog in the shipment of
a purchased product, together with a discount coupon to induce a purchase from
that catalog. Or, it might take the form of a similar coupon sent by e-mail, with a link
to the web version of that catalog.

But which catalog should be enclosed in the box or included as a link in the e-mail
with the discount coupon? Exeter would like it to be an informed choice—a catalog
that has a higher probability of inducing a purchase than simply choosing a catalog
at random.

#### Assignment
Using the dataset CatalogCrossSell.csv, perform an association rules analysis, and
comment on the results. Your discussion should provide interpretations in English
of the meanings of the various output statistics (lift ratio, confidence, support) and
include a very rough estimate (precise calculations are not necessary) of the extent
to which this will help Exeter make an informed choice about which catalog to crosspromote to a purchaser.
