# Data Mining 
In this repo, I identify and apply analytical techniques used to support business decision making in a range of applications that include: customer segmentation, predictive modeling (linear regression, decision trees), market basket analysis, text mining. 

Problems from "Data Mining for Business Analytics - Concepts, Techniques and Applications in Python"

#### 1 - Data Mining Basics
Resolution of problems centered around the following concepts:
- Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
- Model overfitting
- Data normalization and partitioning
- Fundamentals of Pandas, Numpy and Sklearn libraries

#### 2 - Data Visualization
- Pandas Series and DataFrames data processing and cleaning
- Plotting of different graphs representing manipulated and aggregated data: Line graphs, Scatter plots, Box plots, Bar charts

#### 3 - EDA and Dimensionality Reduction (Principal Component Analysis)
- Quantitative, Numerical, Ordinal and Nominal variables
- Mean, median, max, min, standard deviation of quantitative variables
- Advanced data analysis of cereals nutricious values, correlations with other valiables such us calories and consumer ratings predictions

#### 4 - Multiple Linear Regression
- Creation of a regression model to predic housing pricing in Boston, Massachusset, using a carefully selected number of predictor variables

#### 5 - Logistic Regression and Classification Tree
- confusion matrices, lift charts
- error rates, sensitivity and specificity of a logistic regression model
- Classification tree fitting
